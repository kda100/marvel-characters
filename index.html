            <p>A wealthy American business magnate, playboy,
                philanthropist,
                inventor and ingenious scientist, Anthony Edward Stark suffers a severe chest injury during a
                kidnapping. When his captors attempt to force him to build a weapon of mass destruction, he instead
                creates a mechanized suit of armor to save his life and escape captivity. Later, Stark develops his
                suit, adding weapons and other technological devices he designed through his company, Stark Industries.

            <h2>Captain America</h2>
            <img src="https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/howstrongis/images/3/36/Captain_america_marvel_cinematic_universe.png/revision/latest?cb=20181015200410"
                alt="Captain America image" height="150" width="75">
            <p>The character wears a costume bearing an American flag motif, and he utilizes a nearly-indestructible
                shield that he throws as a projectile. Captain America is the alter ego of Steve Rogers, a frail young
                artist enhanced to the peak of human perfection by an experimental "super-soldier serum" after joining
                the military to aid the United States government's efforts in World War II

                alt="Hulk image" height="250" width="200">
            <p>Following his accidental exposure to gamma rays while saving the life of Rick Jones during the detonation
                of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional
                stress, at or against his will. This transformation often leads to destructive rampages and to conflicts
                that complicate Banner's civilian life.

                alt="Thor image" height="150" width="100">
            <p> The character is based on the Norse mythological god of the same name, the Asgardian god of thunder
                whose enchanted hammer Mjolnir enables him to fly and manipulate weather, among his other superhuman
                attributes. A founding member of the superhero team the Avengers, Thor has a host of supporting
                characters and enemies.
